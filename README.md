# deep-learning-challenge

In this challenge I created a neural network to try to predict which applicants to a venture funding foundation would be successful. I then optimized the model and wrote up an analysis of the model, it's accuracy, and my recommendations for further optimization. 

The code used in the project was developed by me through my learning in the UMN Data Science Bootcamp.
